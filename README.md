The **aidKRIYA Walker App** is a social wellness mobile application developed for the **Aidothon 4.0 - Walker App Challenge 2025** organized by the **Gita & Susil Kumar Das (GnSkD) Foundation**.

## 🔄 App Flow 

1. **Login / Register via Google**  
   - Both Walkers and Wanderers authenticate using Google Sign-In.  
   - User roles are determined from Firestore (Walker or Wanderer).  

2. **Select Role → Walker / Wanderer**  
   - The user is directed to their respective dashboards.  
   - The app updates the user’s **online/offline status** in Firestore in real time.  

3. **Set Up Profile**  
   - Each user completes their profile with photo, age, gender, interests, preferred walking time, and location preferences.  
   - Walkers undergo verification before being visible for matching.  

4. **Request Phase (Wanderer → Walker)**  
   - A Wanderer can **send a walk request** to a nearby available Walker.  
   - If both are **online**, the request instantly appears on the Walker’s dashboard.  
   - If the Walker is **offline**, a **push notification** is sent via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).  
   - Tapping the notification opens the app directly on the **Incoming Request Screen**, allowing the Walker to accept or decline the request.  

5. **Acceptance & Cancellation Logic**  
   - Once the Walker **accepts**, both users enter the “Ready to Walk” state.  
   - The **Walker** alone can start the walk (to ensure accountability).  
   - If the **Walker cancels** before or during the walk → The total **amount payable becomes ₹0** (no charge to Wanderer).  
   - If the **Wanderer cancels**, a **partial deduction** applies based on elapsed time (e.g., cancellation fee proportional to minutes booked).  
   - Both users receive in-app alerts and push notifications about acceptance, start, or cancellation events.  

6. **Real-Time Tracking**  
   - Once started by the Walker, both users can track live GPS locations on an embedded Google Map.  
   - The backend continuously logs **duration**, **distance**, and **status (active/completed)** in Firestore.  

7. **Walk Completion & Payment**  
   - The Walker ends the session once the walk is completed.  
   - Payment is automatically calculated and processed via Razorpay/UPI.  
   - Both parties are prompted to rate and review each other.  

8. **Post-Walk Summary**  
   - A detailed summary (date, distance, duration, total cost, and partner rating) is stored in **Walk History**.  
   - Users can view past walks and earnings (for Walkers) in their dashboards.
